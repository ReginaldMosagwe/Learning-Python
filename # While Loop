####             # WHILE LOOP IN Python

# With the WHILE LOOP, we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
# Example:

x = 1
while x < 7: # Condition
    print(x)
    x += 1 # Remember to increment as shown or else the loop continues forever

#                   #The break statement

# Within a while loop, using the break statement can stop the loop even when the condition is true
# For example to stop a loop when x = 4:

x = 1
while x < 7:
    print(x)
    if x == 4:
        break # Exit the loop when x is 4
    i += 1

#                   # The continue statement

# With the continue statement, one can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next

x = 0 #iteration's starting point
while x < 7: # condition
    x += 1 # increment
    if x == 4: 
        continue
    print(x)

#                   # The else Statement

# With else, one can run a block of code once the condition is false

x = 0
while x < 7:
    print(x)
    x += 1
else:
    print("x is no longer less than 7")
